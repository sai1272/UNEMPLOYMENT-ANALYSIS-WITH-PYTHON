# UNEMPLOYMENT-ANALYSIS-WITH-PYTHON

# Unemployment Analysis with Python

This project focuses on analyzing unemployment data to understand trends and patterns, particularly the impact of COVID-19 on the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate is calculated as the percentage of people who are unemployed from the total labor force. By analyzing unemployment trends, this project aims to offer insights into how economic factors like pandemics influence job markets.

### Problem Description
Unemployment is a key indicator of economic health. The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions to the global labor market, leading to sharp increases in unemployment rates. In this project, we analyze historical unemployment data to visualize these trends, identify significant changes, and predict future unemployment rates based on various factors.

### Dataset
The project uses publicly available unemployment data, which typically includes variables such as:
- Year/Month
- Unemployment Rate
- Number of Unemployed Individuals
- Labor Force Participation Rate
- Economic Indicators (e.g., GDP, inflation)

You can find the dataset from reliable sources such as [FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/), or use any relevant local or international datasets.

### Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection**: Gather unemployment data from public datasets (e.g., government websites, economic data repositories).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset (handling missing values, normalization, etc.).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trends in unemployment rates, especially before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Investigate how other economic indicators (e.g., GDP, inflation) correlate with unemployment.
5. **Time Series Analysis**: Model and forecast future unemployment rates using time series techniques like ARIMA or Prophet.
6. **Insights and Predictions**: Generate actionable insights and make predictions about future unemployment trends.

### Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`, `prophet`
